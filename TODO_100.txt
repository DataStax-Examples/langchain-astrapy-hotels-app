TODOs for the transition to astrapy 1.0.0

. ~/.virtualenvs/hotels-astrapy100-3.10/bin/activate

X reformulate dependencies altogether

X tweak req and temporarily dep-install steps to achieve 1.0.0

X get DB(s) decouple from get LC things. the latter through creds

- get setup steps to work
  x 2
  x 3
  x 4
  x 5

x get app to work without llm caching

x get app to work with caching

x how to fit the 6th in 1st db (see below)

x remove the explicit batching for insertions in setup
    a big insert_many + ordered=False + concurrency
    x in 3
    x in 5

- select_review_count_by_hotel => use count_documents and handle bound-hit error with elegant "100+ reviews" marker (requires slight client tweak as well) The indexing deny["*"] should make everything work in a single DB

- check readme and other writeup

- check gitpod, ragstackify (how?)

- all these get_db in functions and then instantiation of Collections -> replace with more centralized thing
