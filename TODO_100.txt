x get app to work with caching

x how to fit the 6th in 1st db: The indexing deny["*"] makes everything work in a single DB

x remove the explicit batching for insertions in setup
    a big insert_many + ordered=False + concurrency
    x in 3
    x in 5

x select_review_count_by_hotel => use count_documents and handle bound-hit error with elegant "100+ reviews" marker (requires slight client tweak as well) 

- check readme and other writeup

- check gitpod, ragstackify (how?)

x all these get_db in functions and then instantiation of Collections -> replace with more centralized thing
