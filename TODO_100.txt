- get setup steps to work
  x 2
  x 3
  x 4
  x 5

- get app to work

- test with/out caching on the 6th coll
- how to fit the 6th in 1st db
- select_review_count_by_hotel => use count_documents and handle bound-hit error
- check readme and other writeup
- check gitpod, ragstackify (how?)

- remove the explicit batching for insertions in setup, also the concurrency probably
- all these get_db in functions and then instantiation of Collections -> replace with more centralized thing

- CITIES: not really used (until the day of geosearch and/or autocomplete). Remove the collection and fit everything in 5 collections.
- Also later keep this a local json (it's a fre k records anyway)
